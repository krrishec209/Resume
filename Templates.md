**************************

I am a Senior Software Engineer working at Google with 7+ years of experience. I've seen resumes of 500+ software engineers while working at Flipkart, Uber & Google.

Here are the 6 most important things I’ve learned about building a resume that actually gets interviews in 2025:

► 1. Don't write your resume before studying the market 
Most engineers open a blank doc and start typing their achievements. 
→ Wrong move. 

✅ First, shortlist 10 companies you want to work at. 
✅ Open 20–30 job descriptions for the role you want (SDE1/SDE2/Infra/ML etc.) 
✅ Write down the common patterns in what they’re hiring for. 

That’s your roadmap. 
Your resume should reflect what those companies care about,  not what you feel like writing.

► 2. Your bullet points are weak because they list tasks, not outcomes 

Bad: “Worked on microservices for the payments team” 

Better: “Built 3 backend services for the payments team handling 1M+ transactions/day” 

Best: “Built & scaled 3 backend services to handle 1M+/day txn traffic with <150ms P95 latency”

→ Always answer: 
What did I build? 
How many users did it serve? 
What changed because of my work?

(Also, I am having an exclusive session on Resume Building where I will break down what works for your resume when applying to top companies.

► 3. Your resume is not a feature list, it’s a proof of value 

Don’t just say “Python, Java, Kubernetes” in skills. 

Say what you did with them. 
→ Used Kubernetes to reduce deployment time from 15 minutes to 2. 
→ Used Python to build an internal tool that saved 30 engineer-hours/week.

No one cares what you know.
they care what you’ve shipped.

► 4. Format like a professional
→ Avoid tables, sidebars & skill bars with dots. 
→ Use Calibri or Arial, 11–12pt font, 1 column. 
→ 1-page for <6 YOE. Max 2 pages even if you're a Staff+. 
→ Save as PDF. No Canva or screenshots.

It’s your first impression
Make it a damn good one!

► 5. Don’t include unnecessary details

❌ “Hardworking, quick learner, good communicator.” 
❌ “Team player with strong interpersonal skills.” 

These are baseline expectations, not selling points. 
You’re wasting space. Say something only you can say.

► 6. If you’ve been laid off, or switching roles. own the story 

Use a 2-line summary to clarify it. 
→ “Laid off during org-wide restructuring in Jan 2024. 
Now seeking backend SDE roles focused on scale & infra.” 

Clear, honest, and helpful for the recruiter.

You get ~8 seconds of attention from a recruiter.
If your resume doesn’t show value in the top third, it won’t be read.
